The academic experience has evolved — but its information systems haven’t.
Critical updates, assignment schedules, feedback reports, and announcements are fragmented across Gmail, Google Classroom, and multiple portals. Students and faculty are drowning in digital noise, losing productivity, deadlines, and academic clarity.



.Centralized API Integration: Bridges Gmail, Google Classroom, and Google Calendar with minimal latency and absolute security.

.AI-Powered Data Parsing: Interprets email bodies, attachments, and Classroom posts using LLMs (Gemini / GPT-based).

.Autonomous Calendar Control: Scans documents and messages to extract event metadata and auto-syncs with Google Calendar in real time.

.Cross-System Notification Engine: Dispatches Telegram, SMS, and internal alerts triggered by urgency, keywords, or deadlines.

.Contextual Intelligence Cache: Maintains a vectorized context memory to serve AI search queries, enabling semantic retrieval across email and coursework history.
